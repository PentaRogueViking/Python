"""
Bidirectional Search Algorithm.

This algorithm searches from both the source and target nodes simultaneously,
meeting somewhere in the middle. This approach can significantly reduce the
search space compared to a traditional one-directional search.

Time Complexity: O(b^(d/2)) where b is the branching factor and d is the depth
Space Complexity: O(b^(d/2))
