Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is an ordering of vertices
such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

    Performs topological sorting on a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

    Args:
        graph: A dictionary representing the adjacency lists of the graph
               where keys are nodes and values are lists of adjacent nodes.

    Returns:
        A list of nodes in topologically sorted order.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the graph contains a cycle (topological sort not possible).

        >>> # 1 -> 2 -> 3
